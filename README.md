SE Sprint 01, Team 29

Looking at the documentation provided for implementation, there seems to be no backend system to store the data into an database. Therefore an important improvement on the current designs seems to be is to provide an ER diagram for the beer game using the information provided in the documentation such as the UML diagram. 

Improvement made till : March 09
  - Folder called SE is the Django framework used to create the server side of the beer game furthur comments can be found in the readme file provided in the folder about how to run the code
  - Folder labeled beergame in the Frontend React.js interface.
  - Using the sqllite file provided by Django framework we can now include all the create tables command in the file ctreate_tables.sql. This allow our Django web platform to communicate with the tables and store values in the tables like a database. 
All the above changes we towards the web platform. Now we have also included 

  Requirements files and creating entity functions :
  - In addition adding all functions for the player entity in the player.py file
  - And a simple layout for the user interface in the user interface file.
  - Also the supplychainstatics.py file uses matplotlib.pyplot library provided by python to create plots for the different player(Retailers, Wholesaler etc)
