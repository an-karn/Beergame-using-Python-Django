# se-01-team-29
SE Sprint 01, Team 29

Looking at the documentation provided for implementation, there seems to be no backend system to store the data into an database. Therefore an important improvement on the current designs seems to be is to provide an ER diagram for the beer game using the information provided in the documentation such as the UML diagram. 

Improvement made till : March 09
- Folder called SE is the Django framework used to create the server side of the beer game furthur comments can be found in the readme file provided in the folder about how to run the code
- Folder labeled beergame in the Frontend React.js interface.
